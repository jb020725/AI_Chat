Q: I'm a Nepali student applying for a South Korean D-4 (General Student) visa. The document checklist seems overwhelming! What are the absolute MUST-HAVE documents I need to prepare, and are there any Nepal-specific requirements I should be aware of? A: The must-have documents for a D-4 visa from Nepal can be categorized into four key areas: Practical Tips: Research thoroughly; Prepare early\n2. Q: I'm a Nepali student applying for a D-4 (General Student) visa to South Korea. How much money do I need to show in my bank account to prove I can support myself financially during my studies? A: While the official amount required can fluctuate slightly based on the specific university and immigration office, a safe estimate is to have at least  KRW 10 million (approximately NPR 1 million) per year of your intended study period readily available. For example, if you plan to study for a two-year master's program, aim to show around KRW 20 million (NPR 2 million) in your bank account. This money should be in a bank account under your name, or your parent's name if they are sponsoring you. Be prepared to provide a bank statement showing the balance and transaction history for the past six months. It's highly recommended to maintain this balance consistently for several months before applying for the visa. You might also need additional documentation like a sponsorship letter from your parents, their bank statements, and proof of their income if they are sponsoring your education. Practical Tips: Research thoroughly; Prepare early\n3. Q: I'm a Nepali student planning to study Korean language in South Korea on a D-4 visa. What are the general timelines and deadlines I need to be aware of regarding the visa application process? A: The D-4 visa process can take several months, so starting early is crucial. Here's a general timeline (keep in mind these are estimates and can vary): Practical Tips: Research thoroughly; Prepare early\n4. Q: My chosen language program in South Korea starts in September. When is the latest I can submit my D-4 visa application to the Korean Embassy in Nepal? A: While there isn't a fixed \"latest\" date, aiming for at least 3 months before your program's start date is strongly recommended. So, for a September intake, try to submit everything by June. Here are some tips for meeting deadlines: Practical Tips: Research thoroughly; Prepare early\n5. Q: How can I increase my chances of D-4 visa approval as a Nepali student heading to South Korea, focusing on showcasing a strong academic purpose? A: A convincing academic purpose is crucial. Korean immigration officers want to see that your chosen program aligns with your previous studies and future career goals. For example, if you have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Tribhuvan University and are applying for a Master's in Artificial Intelligence in Korea, clearly articulate how the Korean program builds upon your existing skills, provides specific expertise not available in Nepal, and advances your career aspirations in AI, perhaps mentioning specific Korean companies or research opportunities you're interested in. Include concrete examples like previous projects, research papers, or work experience that demonstrate your passion and commitment to your field. A well-defined study plan outlining your intended courses, research topics, and expected outcomes can further strengthen your application. Translate all Nepali documents into Korean or English with certified translations. Practical Tips: Research thoroughly; Prepare early\n\n\n### General Steps:\n1.
