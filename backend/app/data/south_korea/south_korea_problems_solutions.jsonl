For example, if you plan to study for a two-year master's program, aim to show around KRW 20 million (NPR 2 million) in your bank account. This money should be in a bank account under your name, or your parent's name if they are sponsoring you. Be prepared to provide a bank statement showing the balance and transaction history for the past six months. It's highly recommended to maintain this balance consistently for several months before applying for the visa. You might also need additional documentation like a sponsorship letter from your parents, their bank statements, and proof of their income if they are sponsoring your education.

Q: How can I increase my chances of D-4 visa approval as a Nepali student heading to South Korea, focusing on showcasing a strong academic purpose? A: A convincing academic purpose is crucial. Korean immigration officers want to see that your chosen program aligns with your previous studies and future career goals. For example, if you have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Tribhuvan University and are applying for a Master's in Artificial Intelligence in Korea, clearly articulate how the Korean program builds upon your existing skills, provides specific expertise not available in Nepal, and advances your career aspirations in AI, perhaps mentioning specific Korean companies or research opportunities you're interested in. Include concrete examples like previous projects, research papers, or work experience that demonstrate your passion and commitment to your field. A well-defined study plan outlining your intended courses, research topics, and expected outcomes can further strengthen your application.

Q: What practical steps can a Nepali student take to demonstrate financial stability for the D-4 visa, which is a frequent concern? A: Demonstrating sufficient funds is essential. Provide bank statements showing consistent transactions over the past six months, covering tuition fees and living expenses in Korea. A sponsor's letter (if applicable) should be notarized and clearly state their relationship to you, their commitment to supporting your studies, and include their financial documents. Scholarship awards, if any, should be officially documented. If your sponsor is in Nepal, ensure their financial standing is verifiable and well-documented. Consider providing evidence of property ownership or a fixed deposit certificate in Nepal to further demonstrate your or your sponsor's financial stability. Prepare a detailed budget outlining your expected expenses in Korea (including accommodation, food, transportation, health insurance, etc.) to showcase your financial planning skills and assure the immigration officer that you can manage your finances responsibly. Remember currency conversions should be accurate and up-to-date.
